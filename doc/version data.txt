Goal: speed everything up
(add compression to reduce file access operations)

what i actually did: add the compression, allow mouse zooming
faster, but needs work
ideas for speedup:
* add "paging" (write each data point to an array, then dump the whole array to the mdata file/ read a chunk into an array)
* use the SSEx instruction set to compute a few points at once
* use a heuristic (ex. if the last few points have the same value, we can predict the next few points)
